This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

This exercise is meant to show the Team how you work and communicate your ideas and developments. If you need some more details/help feel free to reach cto@allaw.fr.

**This exercise is mainly testing your ability to develop components in NextJs. You will have to develop a small library of components in a new NextJs project. You have to use TypeScript.**

## **1- Create a NextJs project.**

Create a new NextJs project in typescript and host your code on a new Github Repo (share it with GermainCTO: [cto@allaw.fr](mailto:cto@allaw.fr)).

## **2- Create a component folder**

Organize your folder architecture the way you want and create a component folder.

## **3- Create a component called ButtonPrimary**

In this component folder create another folder called buttons and create ButtonPrimary.tsx. Now, based on the following figma implement this button component as precisely as possible and as custom as necessary (icon before, after, external styling, …). Please use only CSS and NextJS.

## **4- Create a component called AppointementStatusTag**

Create another folder called tags and create AppointementStatusTag.tsx. Now, based on the following figma implement this tag component as precisely as possible and as custom as necessary. Please use only CSS and NextJS.

## **5- Display your work on a Storybook**

Use a storybook to display your two components and to test tem with different states/props
